			IMAGEBUCKET
It was a 24 hour hack in Yahoo! HackU, IIT Kanpur.

What it does?
Takes input the folder address (compulsory), and optional: No. of persons in image, Size of image, Prominent Color of the image, Range in which the image was added to the folder.


Why it does?
Searching by filename and date is too irritating at times.


How it does?
Back end: Runs a python code (test.py) on all the images(e.g. JPG) and extracts these informations and metadata.
Writes these data to a text file in csv format(test.txt)

Front end: PHP script for query and fast response by just reading through the database file.

Possibilities!
Face recognition on family photos and add tags in the database, which will give an added feature of search by name.
